# node-collections-syncer
Storage agnostic and simple way to denormalize data for reporting etc (CQRS) 

**DO NOT USE IT NOW**
It is on prototype phase. We try to cover more edge cases and this is just a PoC. **Wait until the module is released to NPM**

**TODO**
1. More examples working with aggregations
2. Support for ENTITY DELETE event
3. Schema validation 
4. Cover everything with tests.
5. Real examples with sequalize and Mongoose
